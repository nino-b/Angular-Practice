# Content Projection with Fallback Content

## Objective:

Create a Modal component that displays a title, body, and footer content. If no footer content is provided, display a default "Close" button.

## Instructions:

1. Create a Modal component with placeholders for the title, body, and footer using '<ng-content>'.
2. Use a fallback mechanism to display a "Close" button in the footer if no content is projected into the footer placeholder.
3. Use the Modal component in another component and project different content into the title, body, and footer.
