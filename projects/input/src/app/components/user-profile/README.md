# Required Inputs and Input Aliases

## Objective:

Use required inputs and input aliases in a component.

1. Create a Component:

- Create a component named UserProfile that requires an input property named username and optionally accepts an alias named user.
- Ensure that the username property is required and that the alias works in the template.

2. Use the Component in a Parent Component:

- In a parent component, use the UserProfile component and bind a value to its username input property using both the original name and the alias.
